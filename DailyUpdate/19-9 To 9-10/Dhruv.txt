Project Title:
FloraBERT: Cross-Species Transfer Learning with Attention-Based Neural Networks for Gene Expression Prediction

Timeline: September 19, 2023, to October 9, 2023

Overall Objective: To develop and implement FloraBERT for gene expression prediction, utilizing data from Ensembl, RefSeq, and MaizeGDB.

September 19-23, 2023 (5 days):
We read and understood a research paper called "FloraBERT" to get ideas.

September 24-26, 2023 (3 days):
We looked at the code used in the FloraBERT project on GitHub to see how it was made.

September 27-29, 2023 (3 days):
We collected the information we needed from places like Ensembl, RefSeq, and MaizeGDB. This part was tricky because it's hard to find the right data.

September 30, 2023 (1 day):
We successfully got the data we needed from Ensembl, RefSeq, and MaizeGDB. This was a big step because it gave us the data to teach our models.

October 3-5, 2023 (3 days):
We prepared the data for our models by cleaning it and making it ready for analysis. We used some code from the FloraBERT project for this.

October 6-9, 2023 (4 days):
We combined gene information for specific animals and plants, like HP301, IL14H, Ki3, and Ki11. We used a platform called Usegalaxy to make sure our gene data was correct. This was important for understanding how genes work in these species.
These steps helped us build FloraBERT and use it to study genes in different animals and plants.
