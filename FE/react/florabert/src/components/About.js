                <h2>FloraBERT: A Genomic Language Model</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>1. Purpose:</b>
                    Genomic Sequence Analysis: FloraBERT appears to be tailored for tasks involving the analysis of
                    genetic
                    sequences, such as DNA and RNA.
                    Bioinformatics Applications: The model is likely used for various bioinformatics applications,
                    including
                    species differentiation, positional importance analysis, k-mer analysis, and gene expression
                    prediction.
                    <br />
                    <b>2. Components:</b>
                    Transformer Architecture: The model is built on a transformer architecture, a type of neural network
                    architecture known for its effectiveness in processing sequential data.
                    Pretrained Model: The code references loading a pretrained model for genomic analysis, suggesting
                    that
                    the model has undergone training on a large dataset.
                    <br />
                    <b>3. Potential Use Cases:</b>
                    Genomic Research: FloraBERT is likely beneficial for researchers in genomics, aiding in tasks
                    related to
                    understanding genetic sequences, identifying species, and uncovering insights from genomic data.
                    Agricultural Studies: Applications may extend to agriculture, including the analysis of cultivars
                    and
                    understanding genetic factors related to crops.
